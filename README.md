Hey, Im TraceAPI. My real name is Eoin Dooley. I am from Ireland.

I am getting into front and backend web development although I want to branch out as I go

I am relativley new to devlopment... I know the basic use and syntax of Java and JavaScript.
I have a decent amount of knowledge in HTML and CSS.

If you want to contance me for any reason my discord is TraceAPI#0001 and my email is eoindooley@gmail.com


I own a up and coming minecraft server and I hope to be involved in more projects as I go along!


[sorry if it takes me a while to get back to you my DM's on discord are rather flooded atm as I have a lot of people trying to get
to me to ask quesitons!]



Thanks,

Eoin
